<h1>Calculator with ajax</h1>


<ul>
<li>After you read it open the calculator code in your editor. If you haven't written that just copy the code of it to your local machine and add it to a git repository.</li>
<li>Add a new div element to the page under the calculator with an id.</li>
<li>After this use numbersapi (Links to an external site.) to show interesting facts about the calculation result's all digit. For this you can use the batch requests of numbers API. When the user hit click on the "=" sign then make an HTTPRequest to the numbersapi page and get the necessary info which you will get in a JSON (Links to an external site.) format.</li>
<li>You can store the already got number facts in an array or even in the local storage (Links to an external site.) to reduce the number of HTTP request.</li>
